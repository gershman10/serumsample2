            <p>
Value is only a perception of how well something connects you to yourself. 
	    </p>
	    <p>
<em>Values</em> are characteristics; descriptors that sort things we generally experience value in. Justice. Freedom. Equality. Brotherhood. Compassion. Forgiveness. These words often pique our perceptions, and raise feelings we find important. They may be pillars, or anchors, for us; helping us decide which way is up, and helping us decide how to act and live. But there is something deeper. 
            </p>
            <p>
There is you -- the real you. The mind goes through life as if going through a constant amnesia, and value -- value is the experience of a breadcrumb, a whiff, a light graze that reminds you of you. You can experience value in a painting. You can experience it in music. You can experience it in the giving of compassion or forgiveness. You can experience it watching compassion or forgiveness given by someone else, unsought and unexpected. It is like the smell of a pine forest recalling you to your childhood when you experience value -- it is the recalling of yourself to yourself.            </p>
            <p>
All else is dementia. Just as a person may pick up the phone and call her child to repeat and re-repeat the same question, re-re-repeating the same question when the mind doesn't register an answer of value, so too do we boil our blood over the same problems, the same fights, the same arguments, and the same justifications over and over and over and over and over again. In the end we always find dust, and dismal suffering. Every time. In that moment we decide we'll never, ever, ever forget again. And then we forget, and the cycle repeats.
            </p>
            <p>
It is through value that we find our way. It is through value that we remember what we forgot. It is in recognizing the experience of value, and recognizing our ability to create things of value that we resolve the repetition and resolve our amnesia. And the truly beautiful thing is, in the act of valuable creation, the byproducts are a marvelous myriad. Imagine a place, littered with objects, experiences, ideas, and agents of value; snapping everyone who enters it out of their amnesia. And imagine its opposite: a land scattered with emptiness. A place of objects, experiences, and ideas blaring with nothing; with everyone in that land wandering aimlessly in circles forgetting, re-forgetting, and re-re-forgetting. 
            </p>
            <p>
Being brushed on the cheek by value is a sublime experience. It's something that we look for, but often forget we're looking for; like when you enter a room to get your keys but forget and leave. You only need to remember not to forget. And if you forget, it's okay. There are other people who remember and will remind you --
            </p>
            <p>
often without your even noticing.
