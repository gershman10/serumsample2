<p>
Bliss is the whole, and the whole the sum of its parts. Bliss is allowing the individual parts to pass and reaquiring them in the whole. Allow yourself to discard the individual parts of yourself and of life and aquire them again when you observe them in the whole.
</p>
<p>
All singular and individal aspects of life are sought in the interest of something greater. Objects, people, places, and endeavors are examples of what is singular. Within them lie the capacity for allowing yourself to grow and find bliss. However, just as we find entire worlds in pale blue dots, and the totality of our existence in the trickling grains of sand, so too do we lose ourselves trying to find entirety in the mere grains that are the singular parts of our experience.
</p>
<p>
Bliss is a treasure you already possess, tucked under and within the beautiful, myriad parts and distractions of what is within you and around you. We find a taste of bliss in a friend, a job, an idea, or an experience; but find ourselves lost in the fading flavor of one facet, one finger, or one organ of the body which we really seek. With the taste still on our tongue, we think it difficult to let go and lift ourselves from what we know, to taste the totality of that which truly is. Fear, expectation, lies, and contrivance keep us in place until the taste fades completely, and we realize ourselves disoriented and lost.
</p>
<p>
But this bliss never fades. There is no key to unlock it. There is no map to reach it. There is no education which can teach you that which you already know. Bliss is only that which can be unlearned, forgotten, and distracted from. Bliss can be covered in malice and violence given and received, but is always there for you in a well that never dries. Hope is merely the memory that bliss is already in your possession; that it is only forgotten in the parts which form its whole. There is no need for trust or belief when you realize you only need to remember that which you already know to achieve that which you wish to acquire. Bliss has never rested on the top of the highest mountain, has never hidden in the most remote island, and has never been at the peak of any enterprise. It rests within you, yourself; not sought, but observed; not built, but allowed to emerge. Let go, and find yourself found. Let go, and receive what is yours. There is no there, there. It is here. There is no place where you will find yourself except where you, yourself stand -- still, and ever-present.
