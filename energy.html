The energy to build the greatest castles, rearrange the highest constellations, and cause the greatest rivers to spill forth surges within us. Each of us grates against the meshes of what hold us back, waiting for our chance to spring forth into tomorrow. Tomorrow, where we may dream of our talents being built to the fullest, or perhaps simply seek, rather, a life in the harmony which comes from being truly ourselves – the self that doesn't need to prove anything, contrive any image, or live any lie just to win bread for the night's dinner.  						</p>
						<p>
Only caged animals wait for their needs to be met for them. As we are not caged animals, the path toward this reality will not suddenly be delivered to us by hand. We cannot wait for a great leader, tide change, or celestial alignment to deign to cut through our strife for us. Yet, as we have tried to voluntarily seed power away from ourselves and toward central authorities, so have we tried to outsource accountability away from ourselves and toward these authorities. This has always been an illusion. Our accountability has always been within ourselves to reach our own personal fulfillment, in whatever direction our will leads us. These central authorities in business and in government have been overburdened and cluttered with our expectations, as we have robbed ourselves of the authority to live our own lives and carve our own paths. Try as they may to accommodate our fantasy of being beasts of burden, we seem to find ourselves unable to properly fit the yoke in our teeth.						</p>
						<p>
Create what you want to create, don't create what you don't want to create. Cleave to what feels right, and dispel that which doesn't. The strength to endure the suffering that comes from failure, as well as the expectations placed on yourself from success, is within you. As with the inspiration of young children, true inspiration does not come from want of fame, wealth, or ambition. True inspiration comes from the will that can't help but flow forth from you – when you allow it. Contrivances justifying repression and suspension are merely a self-imposed form of bondage.  						</p>
						<p>
Casting blame may be sensual to the palate, however it inevitably causes indigestion and colic; in the end, pangs of hunger. Eat from from the fruits of life – sometimes bitter, sometimes sweet, but always filling. Let's make living life as yourself <em>en vogue</em>. We've seen the consequences of living our lives guided by our own vanity, greed, pride, finger-pointing, hatred, and sophistry. As cracks shine beams of light in a dark room, so too does the splendor of life shine through when your eyes are open.						</p>
						<p>
When you believe it, you will see it. There is no vice versa. A man in the desert who's been blinded by the relentless sun and numbed by the searing heat must first believe there is water, however weary he may be, if he wants to live; lest he resign and spite his fate as oasis finds itself right under his feet.  						</p>
						<p>
The world is ready, waiting for you to get started and carve your path. Liberate yourself and see what's in front of you. Serve yourself and your communities without expectation, and you will find yourself served –  your coursing energy, realized.
						</p>
