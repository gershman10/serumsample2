						<p class="lead">The way to go is exactly the way you are going.</p> 

            <p>
            It is a truth that is repeated an re-repeated. It is forgotten, learned, and forgotten again. A truth that can be happily passed over with a friendly glance, and one that we can happily forget. You are.
            </p>
            <p>
No other quality sticks to you. Your slate is completely clean, save for the fact that you are; you exist. The only purpose, your only necessity is to be. Just be. This being is immaculate and immutable. The true alpha and omega is to watch alpha, omega, beta, and zeta fade under this light, this quality -- being. Your slate is completely clean.
            </p>
            <p>
When you find that your slate is completely clean, and that the only thing sticking to you is your being, perhaps you may also see that you can do anything. Be anything. Only form is the illusive inhibitor. Being is its absence.
            </p>
            <p>
From this First Principle, you can find other understandings. You can find that your life is unalienable -inseparable- from you, as it is a matter of course that when you are, you have life. You can find that your freedom is also unalienable from you, as when your only real quality is your being, you are free. You will also find that when you have life and are free, the ability to look for happiness is also unalienable from you. Separating your being, and in turn these three deductions, from you is therefore an exercise in the nonsensical. Lastly, as being has no form and therefore no heirarchy, all is equal.
            </p>
            <p>
As there is partition, so must there also be separation. As there is separation, so there is also disunion. We may find ourselves divided and in conflict during these moments. Yet, these observances are as real as mirages in the desert -- we can make them as real as we believe them to be. But when we let these scintillating distractions pass, when we unwind ourselves from their seduction and allow for temporary respite, the partitions also pass. And when partitions pass there is Union.
            </p>
            <p>
If your only true quality is being, nothing is ordained. If nothing is ordained, no ordinance from any source can truly touch or mark you. Trust in the logical positivity of your being so that you may see the true order, and so that we may dust away the cobwebs of what distracted us, together.
            </p>
            <p>
All is transient in the field of entropy. Mountains rise, fall, and rise again. Stars shift, fade, and are born again. Through the duration of your life, the one thing that you can know to always be intransient is your being. In that you can find your bedrock. As the wills of the mind and body guide, yet fetter you; as you find your passions drive, yet chain you; also find that there is only one necessity, one obligation, and one purpose. Be.
