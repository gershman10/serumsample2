						<p>There once was an itty bitty fish in an itty bitty tank.</p>
						<p>Bump,</p><p>Bump,</p><p>Bump,</p><p>Bump.</p>
            <p>
Now, in the very, very back of the itty bitty mind of the itty bitty fish, it remembered a time long ago that confused it, where there wasn't this strange, invisible bump that would always come out of nowhere. This confusion slowly started creeping... and crawling... forward... in the itty bitty mind of the itty bitty fish. The creeping... crawling... confusion... slowly turned into a smoldering... smoking... frustration. Then, the smoldering... smoking... frustration turned into a fiery, angry passion! The fiery, angry fish swam forward as fast as it could!
						</p>
            <p>Bump.</p>
						<p>
After rubbing its itty bitty head with its itty bitty fins, it remembered again that there was a strange thing blocking it that it couldn't understand. The little fish knew not to swim too far forward, but it couldn't remember why. And so it wondered for a little while... then it thought for a little while... then it concentrated for a little while...then it focused for a little while... then it <em>really</em> focused, as hard as it could! But after all that thinking, and concentrating, and focusing, it still couldn't understand. So it got lost and confused.  This confusion slowly started creeping... and crawling... forward... in the itty bitty mind of the itty bitty fish. The creeping... crawling... confusion... slowly turned into a smoldering... smoking... frustration. Then, the smoldering... smoking... frustration turned into a fiery, angry passion! The fiery, angry fish swam forward as fast as it could!
						</p>
	    <p>Bump.</p>
						<p>
This time, the fish became very, very still, and very, very silent. The more still and the more silent the little fish got, the more clear, and more strong its memories became of when it wouldn't hit these invisible, painful bumps. Fuzzy and familiar pictures, feelings, and sounds started to blink, flash, and swish before the itty bitty eyes of the itty bitty fish! It reached out as hard and as far as it could to hold them in its itty bitty fins, but the harder and farther it reached, the fuzzier and swishier everything became. And the fuzzier and swishier everything became, the more confused it became. This confusion kept creeping... and crawling... forward... in the itty bitty mind of the itty bitty fish. The creeping... crawling... confusion... slowly turned into a smoldering... smoking... frustration. Then, the smoldering... smoking... frustration turned into a fiery, angry passion! The fiery, angry fish swam forward as fast as it could!
						</p>
            <p>Bump.</p>
						<p>
After rubbing its itty bitty head with its itty bitty fins, again, It started to swim... again. After swimming forward a little while, it stopped and turned. Then, it swam forward a little bit, and stopped and turned again without knowing why. Then, it swam forward, stopped, and turned a third time! It it didn't understand why it was stopping and going so many times inside such an itty bitty box of space, and it got confused. This confusion slowly started creeping... and crawling... forward... in the itty bitty mind of the itty bitty fish. The creeping... crawling... confusion... slowly turned into a smoldering... smoking... frustration. Then, the smoldering... smoking... frustration turned into a fiery, angry passion! The fiery, angry fish swam forward as fast as it could!
