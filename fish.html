						<p>Bump,</p><p>Bump,</p><p>Bump,</p><p>Bump.</p>

            <p>
In the very, very back of the little fish's mind, it remembers a time when it didn't hit this confusing, invisible bump. This confusion starts to crawl forward in its mind and turn into frustration, then turn to anger and passion. It swims forward as fast as it can.
						</p>
            <p>Bump.</p>
						<p>
It remembers this confusing thing blocking it that it can't understand. It remembers not to swim too far forward, without knowing why. But then, in the very, very back of the little fish's mind, it remembers a time when it didn't hit this confusing, invisible bump. This confusion starts to crawl forward in its mind and turn into frustration, then to agression and passion. It swims forward as fast as it can.
						</p>
            <p>Bump.</p>
						<p>
It becomes still and silent, bringing forward memories of when there wasn't this confusing, invisible bump. Indescernable yet familiar images, feelings, and sounds start to flash; yet before it can hold them it its little fish fins, it becomes confused. This confusion starts to crawl forward in its mind and turn into frustration, then to agression and passion. It swims forward as fast as it can.
						</p>
            <p>Bump.</p>
						<p>
It starts to swim again. Without knowing why, it stops and turns in the other direction, swims, and stops again. It turns in yet another direction, swims and stops again. It becomes confused as to why it's stopping and going within such a small prism of space. This confusion starts to crawl forward in its mind and turn into frustration, then to agression and passion. It swims forward as fast as it can.

            <p>Bump.</p>
