						<p>There once was an itty bitty fish in an itty bitty tank.</p>
						<p>Bump,</p><p>Bump,</p><p>Bump,</p><p>Bump.</p>
            <p>
In the very, very back of the little fish's mind, it remembered a time when it wouldn't hit this confusing, invisible bump. This confusion started to crawl forward in its mind and turn into frustration, then turned to anger and passion. It swam forward as fast as it could.
						</p>
            <p>Bump.</p>
						<p>
It remembered that there was this confusing thing blocking it that it couldn't understand. It remembered not to swim too far forward, without knowing why. But then, in the very, very back of the little fish's mind, it remembered a time when it wouldn't hit this confusing, invisible bump. This confusion started crawling forward in its mind and turned into frustration, then to agression and passion. It swam forward as fast as it could.
						</p>
            <p>Bump.</p>
						<p>
It became still and silent. This brought forward memories of when there wasn't this confusing, invisible bump. Indescernable yet familiar images, feelings, and sounds started to flash; yet before it could hold them in its little fish fins, it became confused. This confusion started to crawl forward in its mind and turned into frustration, then to agression and passion. It swam forward as fast as it could.
						</p>
            <p>Bump.</p>
						<p>
It started to swim again. Without knowing why, it stopped and turned in the other direction, swimming, and stopping again. It turned in yet another direction, swimming and stopping again. It became confused as to why it was stopping and going within such a small prism of space. This confusion started to crawl forward in its mind and turned into frustration, then to agression and passion. It swam forward as fast as it could.
						</p>
            <p>Bump.</p>
