					<p>
As babies, we cry for four reasons: to eat, to be cleaned, out of sleeplessness, and out of the need to be held.
</p>
<p>
Being held is the simplest expression of consolation. When a baby cries and is consoled by being held; the one who holds, the one held, and all those who observe are consoled. Like ripples in a still pond, this consolation moves outward and continues to vibrate, sourced from the singular event.
</p>
<p>
Curiously, babies often continue to cry even after being held. In these moments, merely being held is not enough. Resolution -consolation- must take other forms. 
</p>
<p>
Form is the vehicle of consolation. Gentle songs sung, soft objects toyed with, and kind crib mobiles observed deliver consolation necessarily through form. However, forms are stagnant and inert in themselves; it is what they deliver, what they correspond, and what they communicate which is cried for. And that which is cried for is love; pure, and selflessly given.
</p>
<p>
This cry for selfless love, love given from love and for the sake of giving love, is never outgrown. Merely the cry itself, the expressions, and the sources develop. Expectations and mental constructions can also somewhat obscure the giving and receiving of this love. All the same, like a mother wiping the dry crust from the eyes of a sleepy child, selfless action given purely, for its own sake, softens and clears these constructions and moves all which is inert. It is only for us to soften ourselves, to soften the forms delivering what we give, and to soften the standard of receiving today what we received yesterday which allows for the gentle travel of this giving and receiving between us.
</p>
<p>
Amusingly, babies often cry after being put back down and children are often upset when something desired is deprived from them. This cling to objects and experiences is attachment. Attachment is the cry for the specific forms or reverberations of love rather than love itself, which is formless. Attachment can be made to a mother's arms, a favorite toy, or a favorite song. Just as well, it can also be made to holding, to pacifying, and to care itself. These forms get in the way, distract, and distort the events of consoling and being consoled. It is here where selfless action again softens and clears attachment to old forms. By softening the borders of your self and receiving what lies on the opposing side, you offer gentle and kind resolution which brushes away the dusts of attachment.
</p>
<p>
Over time, we slowly and habitually build complex labyrinths to keep out what is soft, loving, and gentle. We cry out from the center in desperation to be held, yet feel crippling fear when love finds its way in. We fear we may hurt or be hurt by this love and that it might disappear forever. Nevertheless, you must allow this love to melt the walls of what constrict you. Love others and let yourself be loved, and you will know consolation. Do not fear hurting or being hurt by others. In selflessness you see clearly the quaint cries for love that are rejection, judgement, and malice, and the world becomes a field of roses when you fire love back in their direction. In selflessness you brave loss and remain open to the change bringing that which is new. In selflessness you see love saturate all, breathing through inummerable cracks all around you. When you cry for selfless love, love those around you and be completely open. You have nothing to lose.
