There once was a boy named Timmy. Every night after his mommy and daddy put him to bed, he would always have the same dream. He would dream he was a zippy, speedy speed skater in a zippy, red suit skating on an icy, blue obstacle course. He would have this dream so often, that sometimes he would sometimes even daydream he was skating as fast as he could, trying his very best to reach the finish line.
</p>
<p>
This dream would always start over every night for Timmy because at the end of every dream, he wouldn't finish the race! Something would get in the way every time to block him at different parts of the course. And because he couldn't control himself in his dreams, all he could do was watch himself run into things. And he couldn't do a single thing to help himself while he was dreaming.
</p>
<p>
But one day, he noticed something strange. When he decided to help his friend Jimmy who was struggling with a math problem in class that day, the same night he swooshed right past an obstacle that always blocked him in his dream! He was sure he knew how to finish the race now. The next day at school, he got really excited and tried to help Jimmy more with his math. He was sure that if helping with one math problem got him through one obstacle, helping him with ten would help him finish the whole race! Jimmy was so thankful for the help, he even got Timmy an ice cream cone at lunch. Timmy went to bed that night with a big smile on his face, thinking for sure he would finish the course this time.
</p>
<p>
But sadly, even though he swooshed right past the first obstacle just like he did the night before, the next one still blocked him just a few feet ahead! Timmy woke up the next morning sad and confused. Jimmy waved at Timmy that day at school with a big smile on his face, but Timmy still didn't feel any better. Timmy went home with his head hung low and had a big frown on his face all the way until dinner time. There he saw his baby sister trying to solve the same puzzle she always tried to solve at dinner time. He had solved the exact same puzzle many times already, but every time he tried to help her she would get mad and shout, "I can do it myself!" which made him very annoyed. This time though, he tried something different.
</p>
<p>
This time, instead of trying to help her solve the puzzle, all he did was next to her, sitting and waiting as patiently as he could. Even when his mommy and daddy told him his food was getting cold, he would politely take a bite and keep quietly and patiently sitting with her, trying really hard not to say anything when she made a mistake and keeping his smile to himself when she did something right. At first, she really didn't like him watching her and tried to keep him from seeing her work. But after a while, she started to feel better and more relaxed, and before she knew it the puzzle was finished! She couldn't believe it! She finished the puzzle all by herself. He gave her a big hug and went to bed happy, but he didn't know why. After all, he didn't do anything. That night, even though he didn't finish the race, he swooshed right past the second obstacle. 
</p>
<p>
Timmy didn't know it, but he was starting to understand this swooshing feeling a little bit better every time he went through an obstacle at home and at school, by being patient, understanding, and helpful instead of being annoyed, pushy, or forceful. The same feeling he got when swooshing past the old obstacles that used to block him again and again was there when he first helped his friend Jimmy and when he sat with his sister at dinner. Without realizing it, he became gentle with the obstacles blocking him, finding ways to swoosh instead of push or force. Many times, he couldn't do it right so it didn't work, and would get scared. But somehow, someway, he decided to be brave. He accepted being scared and skated forward as fast as he could
</p>
<p>
After everything, Timmy stopped having the dream about skating in his zippy, red suit. And even though he didn't ever get to cross the finish line, he learned an important lesson for himself. He didn’t understand totally or know how to put in to words perfectly, but he learned how to notice the things that were blocking him and the people around him a little better. He also learned how it was okay to do things wrong, and how to feel better about being scared because of it. He kept zipping, speeding, and swooshing and lived happily ever after.
